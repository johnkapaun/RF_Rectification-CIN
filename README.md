# RF_Rectification-CIN
Contains binary data conversions and filtering.  Notice Doxygen is used for documentation purposes.  This is a code interface node (CIN) for Labview used to read and convert DAQ data used to measure RF rectification.  Please note that you will need cin external files, makefile, and doxygen EXE to build this as intended.  I'm not adding them here.
